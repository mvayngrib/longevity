## A decade forward into the future to cure aging, thanks to COVID
RNA-based COVID vaccines that have just come to market, are artificially made Exosomes. That means we have the at-scale production capacity to vaccinate people from aging. 

What remains is to figure out which specific RNA segments to produce. And specific placenta cells (MSC) already give us a sample of Exosomes to study. MSC Exosomes show non-clinical anecdotal results that are akin to a fountain of youth. 

## Background on RNA-based vaccines
COVID virus exhibits a specific protein on its surface a "spike" protein.
Vaccine developers created instructions for the body to produce this "spike" protein. 
Immune system reacts to the vaccine by destroying the "spikey" and clearing COVID along the way. Bingo!

## Now a bit more technical
We are made of proteins. It is a common knowledge that DNA is the source of programming for our body, specifically the instructions to produce proteins. In principle the body manifacturing process consists of 2 steps:

- A copy of the section of the DNA is made in the nucleus. 
- This copy, called RNA is delivered to the protein factories in the cell (ribosomes).

It is unteresting that the cell is dumb and does not know where the RNA came from, from the nucleus, from the virus, or from the vaccine. It sees the RNA and starts producing proteins, dummy :-)

This is how viruses make us sick. The use the same mechanism to trick the cell to produce the proteins that we do not need (or do not need in such quauntities). Virus is just a bubble with the RNA and it is so small that it can sneak into the cell without a problem. Note that many other things can't pass through the cell membrane, and it is a problem drug delivery mechanisms struggle with all the time. Not an issue with RNA.

>RNA is easily destroyed (by enzymes) before it gets into the right place in the cell. So vaccine developers put RNA in the bubble to protect it until it gets to the right place in the cell, to the cell factories that produce proteins based on RNA instructions (ribosomes). 

Turns out our cells themselves produce these RNA bubbles all the time and send them out to other cells. They are called Exosomes and they are excreeted by most of the cells in our body. This way one cell can and is signaling other cells to produce more of certain protein.

This is it. COVID-19 vaccines do the same mechnism. 

Ability to produce Exosomes artificially and at scale, newfound with COVID-19 vaccines, is a huge deal for saving us all from becoming idiots and invalids at the end of our lives. COVID-19 just sped up the time to market for Exosomes by a decade, perhaps quarter of a century. 

I know of 2 labs that already breed Exosomes. They take the Exosomes from the specific placenta cells (MSC) that direct other cells in the early stages of life. These Exosomes can be bread and injected into the bloodstream to act as the fountain of youth for our organs. Well, now we do not need placenta cells, we can produce Exosomes 100% artificially, like we just did with COVID vaccines. No ethical issues, no human tissues. Easier FDA approval.

What we do not yet know is which specific Exosomes do what. We need to study what specific Exosomes are excreeted by MSC and study effects of each. 

But once we do, this is the end of disease of aging and perhaps of aging itself.

## What remains to do and how IT can help?
Information technology is essential to here to help speed up the research, the clinical trials and the FDA approval management process, perhaps by 3-5 years. 

1. This is a highly regulated field. To speed up the process we need to digitize and enforces compliance protocols. 
1. There is an enormous amount of data that needs Data Governance. 
1. Healthcare has challenging data privacy laws.
1. AI is critical accelerator but sourcing data remains a huge challenge, due to privacy issues. If there was a way for AI to process health data, without asking people to give their data away - this could be the key enabler for research,  trials and clinical monitoring applications.
1. Clinical trials are expensive (3 stages cost upwards of $50M). Trial often fails and all starts anew. IT creates automation, which decreases costs.
1. Trials require identification, screening and monitoring of candidates.
1. Trials require identification, screening and monitoring of participating organizations and processes.
1. Trials require auditable transactional structured messaging with participants, both subjects and staff.
1. Trials require workflow for participants and staff.

## Breakthroughs
Measure true bio age - this is fundamental for a scientific method to work. Until now we could not measure the effectiveness of diet, fasting, supplements, exercise, hot-cold showers, lower doses of stress, and of course the clinical.
